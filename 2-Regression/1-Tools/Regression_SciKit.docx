Firstly, the Lineerud dataset would need to be imported into the enivornment in which we are wokring with the dataset. 
Next the dataset would be loaded into a function. The function would then have modle split some of the dataset into a training set and a test set.
After which the model would be trained on the training set and then tested on the test set.
The model would then plot in this case the amount of situps done to the corresponding average waistline measurement.
    It would have to be taken into account that situps are not the only factor that affects waistline measurement. (diet, exercise, etc.)
    This process would be repeated for the other excercise (data) and physiological variables.
